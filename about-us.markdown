## The Project
Wittle presents the real and raw anecdotes from comedians who suffer from depression. Their stories are transformed into short animated stories and as casual games that can be played on any device, for free, without the need to download anything.
<br>
<br>
## Our Mission
Wittle is intended to bring awareness of how depression affects those who suffer from it. Depression is serious, but we want to bring a lighter touch to it by collaborating with comedians, animators and video game developers to help deliver experiences that will draw the largest audience to engage with real stories.
<br>
<br>
## Status
Wittle is currently in the prototype phase. The producers are collaborating with two comedians to transform their stories into short animations and quick to play casual games. We will gather feedback with the help of our partners that will be applied to new stories to be produced in 2020. 
<br>
<br>
## Seeking Stories
We are currently looking for individuals interested in sharing their experience living with depression. We understand that sharing a story related to a mental health condition is not an easy thing to do and that you likely have many questions. You can find information on our process on our [Share Page](http://embreate.com/wittle-website/share-your-story.html). You can contact us by [email](mailto:info@embreate.com) and we'd be happy to answer an question or concerns you may have.
