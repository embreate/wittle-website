## The Project
WITTLE presents real experiences from people suffering anxiety and depression. Their stories are portrayed in short animations and casual, web-based games that can be played on any device. No downloading needed, and they’re all free at [wittle.ca](http://www.wittle.ca)

<br>
<br>
## Our Mission
WITTLE raises awareness of how depression affects those who suffer from it. Depression is serious and complex, so to make these experiences relatable to anyone, WITTLE presents them as games that put the viewer in the comedians’ heads, and in animations told first-hand. The games and videos can be viewed anywhere, anytime on any device streaming from [wittle.ca](http://www.wittle.ca)
<br>
<br>
## Status
