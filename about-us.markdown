**Our Mission**
<br>The Wittle project is focused on the conversation of mental health and how each individual has their own unique experience to share. We believe the action of sharing stories about mental health issues will help to destigmatize them. Our team at Embreate is collecting points of view to create a resource for those that suffer from mental illness, and for those who still donâ€™t fully understand it or wish to learn more. 

Our second goal is to take stories told to us by the community and transform them into playable experiences. Each small game will represent the story of one individual. Currently, we have been working with local Toronto comedians as they express their own experiences. However, we are branching out and looking for more points of view from the community. 

If you have a story you wish to share, feel free to contact us!
