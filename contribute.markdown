### We want to hear from you!

We are collecting stories of individual experiences of those who suffer from depression. If selected your story would be transformed into a 1-2 minute animation and casual style mobile game.

### FAQ

##### What kind of stories are you looking for?
 
 The subject matter we are covering can be a hard topic for anyone to talk about and we want to make sure that all involved feel safe and find the experience rewarding. That being said, we are looking for personal stories that we can use as a base for a game. These stories do not need to be hyper-specific with details you may not be comfortable sharing. Everyone who suffers from depression has different experiences and we wish to represent faithfully what our subjects have gone through. 

##### Do I have to be a comedian to share my story?

No. It's tru that for this stage of the project we are focussing on stories from comedians, improv performers and those who work in the comedy community. But as the project evolves we will likely branch out to explore the mental health realities of other professions. 

##### Is every story accpted into the project?
No. Our selection committee will be deciding which stories are used for the project. 

##### Does the story have to be funny?
 
No. We are working with members of the comedy community but the stories don't need to be funny. 

##### What if I share something with you I donâ€™t wish to be public? 
If after sharing a story and decide that you do not want the topic used for the game, we will take it out of our design possibilities. We will not share any stories that you wish not to be made public.  

##### I have a book/show I would like to plug, will I be able to do that? 
Yes. Each game will have it's own page on the Wittle website with a short bio about the storyteller, you could provide information about your work here along with a link to where people could learn more about it.  

##### Can I Be Anonymous? 
Yes. When we publish your story you could opt to not be mentioned at all or we could only publish your first name. 

##### How much time will I need to commit to the project 
Once your story is accepted the story producer will conduct a pre-interview over the phone or in person which will take no more than an hour. Throughout the process you will be sent drafts of the animation script and the game design bible and you will have an opportunity to provide feedback. At the end of the process we will need you to come into our studio to record the final voice over for the animation and game which would take between one and two hours at most.  
##### How graphic can the stories get? (for instance about the topic of suicide)
This is all dependent on your comfort level. Any stories that you are not comfortable with us using will be quickly dismissed. Share as much as you would like, we want this to be a comfortable experience.
