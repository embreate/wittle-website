## The Game
In the game adaptation of Brian's story players are challenged to navigate his disembodied head around lifes everyday challenges. You can [play his game now](https://drift.wittle.ca). At this time it is only available on Chrome browsers.  

The game follows the exact narrative flow as the animated video, the difference is that you the player must navigate the obstacles between events.
